abstract = {We present explicit analytical solution for the problem of minimization of the function \$ F(x,y)= \backslash sum\_\{j=1\}\^{}3 m\_j \backslash sqrt\{(x-x\_j)\^{}2+(y-y\_j)\^{}2\} \$, i.e. we find the coordinates of stationary point and the corresponding critical value of \$ F(x,y) \$ as functions of \$ \{m\_j,x\_j,y\_j\}\_\{j=1\}\^{}3 \$. In addition, we also discuss inverse problem of finding such values of \$ m\_1,m\_2,m\_3 \$ with the aim for the corresponding function \$ F \$ to posses a prescribed position of stationary point.},
