@article{Fampa2008,
abstract = {We describe improvements to Smith's branch-and-bound (B\&B) algorithm for the Euclidean Steiner problem in R d. Nodes in the B\&B tree correspond to full Steiner topologies associated with a subset of the terminal nodes, and branching is accomplished by "merging" a new terminal node with each edge in the current Steiner tree. For a given topology we use a conic formulation for the problem of locating the Steiner points to obtain a rigorous lower bound on the minimal tree length. We also show how to obtain lower bounds on the child problems at a given node without actually computing the minimal Steiner trees associated with the child topologies. These lower bounds reduce the number of children created and also permit the implementation of a "strong branching" strategy that varies the order in which the terminal nodes are added. Computational results demonstrate substantial gains compared to Smith's original algorithm. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present geometric conditions that can be used to restrict or eliminate candidate topologies for Euclidean Steiner minimal trees in Rd, d ??? 2. Our emphasis is on conditions that are not restricted to the planar case (d = 2). For trees with a Steiner topology we give restrictions on terminal-Steiner connections that are based on the Voronoi diagram associated with the set of terminal nodes. We then describe more restrictive conditions for trees with a full Steiner topology and show how these conditions can be used to improve implicit enumeration algorithms for finding Euclidean Steiner minimal trees with d > 2. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.
