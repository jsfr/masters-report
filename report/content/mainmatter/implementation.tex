\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}
}

This chapter touches on parts of the implementation which are done differently
from Smiths implementation.

The new implementation is written in Googles, still relatively new, language
Golang~\cite{GolangHomepage}

\section{Building topologies}
\label{sec:building-topologies}

Naive approach when building and pruning significantly increases run
time. Explain Smiths approach with a stack sorted on the best seen/most
promising results. This cuts from ~10s to ~0.5s.

\section{Analytical solution to the Fermat-Torricelli problem}
\label{sec:analyt-solut-ferm}

\subsection{2D}
\label{sec:2d}

\subsection{Generalization to higher dimensions}
\label{sec:gener-high-dimens}

\section{Sorting points}
\label{sec:sorting-points}

longest path in fully connected graph is NP-complete [ref]. Greedy approach
shows promising results.
