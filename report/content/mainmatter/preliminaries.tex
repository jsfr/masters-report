% Short introduction to the chapter (max 1/2 page)
This chapter contains all the preliminaries, basic concepts and definitions,
which are needed to understand the work done in the thesis, and which are
not necessarily known to the reader in full.

\NOTE[inline]{This can be a bit more verbose.}

\section{Topology}
\label{sec:topology}

The combinatorial structure of of a tree, or other form of geometric network, is
called a topology. I.e.\ in the topology we only think about the adjacencies of
the points and not their coordinates.

\section{Steiner tree}
\label{sec:steiner-tree}

There are, at least, two different definitions of a Steiner tree both of which a
equivalent. The first, used by Gilbert and Pollak~\cite{Gilbert1968} defines a
Steiner tree, as a tree that cannot be shortened by a small perturbation or by
``splitting'' a terminal by inserting a Steiner point.

Here a Steiner point is an extra vertex which one is allowed to insert into the
graph and use as a ``connection point'' for edges, as can be seen in
\Cref{fig:preliminaries-steiner-point}.

  right.\label{fig:preliminaries-steiner-point}}
\end{figure}

Another definition, used by Smith~\cite{Smith1992}, defines the Steiner tree a
tree with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It contains $N$ ``regular points'' $\vec{x}_1 \cdots \vec{x}_N$, and
  possibly $K$ additional ``Steiner points'' $\vec{x}_{N+1} \cdots
  \vec{x}_{N+K}$.
\item Each Steiner point has valence 3, and the edges emanating from it lie in a
  plane and have mutual angle $120^{\circ}$
\item Each regular point has valence between 1 and 3 (and generally $\le 2$).
\item $0 \le K \le N-2$.
\end{enumerate}

These two definitions are equivalent, however the second one gives some
important information about the structure of the Steiner tree. This thesis will
therefore in general use the second definition.

That the two definitions are indeed equivalent can seen by considering each of
the property of the second definition.

The first property is by definition, and to name the regular points and the
Steiner points.

The second property can be shown in the following way. First of consider that
any Steiner point must have at least valence three. This should be obvious as every
point with valence one can simply be removed to make the length the same or
shorter as they do not lead to any regular point Every Steiner point with
valence two can be removed, and its edges be replaced with one edge which is of
the same length or shorter as per the triangle inequality theorem.

We now show that no pair of edges emanating from a Steiner point can have a
mutual angle less than $120^{\circ}$. Suppose the contrary is the case, and the
lines $PR$ and $RQ$ meet with angle $PRQ < 120^{\circ}$. If we use the
mechanical interpretation given by Gilbert and Pollak~\cite{Gilbert1968} the two
edges ``pull'' on point $R$ with a resultant force of magnitude\NOTE{I don't
  quite get why this is the case?}
\[
F = 2 \cos \theta / 2 > 1
\]
\TODO[inline]{Finish the part about the angles being no less than 120}

Using that the mutual angles can be no less than $120^{\circ}$ it follows that
every Steiner point can have a valence of at most 3, as $120^{\circ} =
360^{\circ}$. We therefore have, using the first part about the valence that a
Steiner point always has exactly valence 3, and as the mutual angles can be no
less than $120^{\circ}$, they must be exactly $120^{\circ}$.

\TODO[inline]{Write proof of third property}

The fourth property follows in the following way from property 3 and 4. Any tree
has one edge fewer than vertices. Thus a Steiner tree has $N+K-1$ edges. Every
edge has two endpoints meaning there are $2N+2K-2$ edges. As every Steiner point
has valence three they account for $3K$ of the endpoints. For the regular points
we must split them in three groups -- $N_1$, those that have valence 1. $N_2$,
those that have valence 2 and, $N_3$, those that have valence 3. Thus the
regular points account for the rest of the endpoints as
$N_1 + 2 N_2 + 3 N_3 \ge N$. We can then write the equation as
\begin{align}
  3K + N_1 + 2N_2 + 3N_3 &= 2N + 2K - 2 \\
  K &= 2N - 2 - (N_1 + 2N_2 + 3N_3) \\
  0 \le K &\le N - 2
\end{align}

\subsection{Full Steiner tree}
\label{sec:full-steiner-tree}

A \gls{fst} is a Steiner tree where all regular points have valence 1, which is
equivalent to the tree having exactly $N-2$ Steiner points, the maximal number
of possible Steiner points. This can easily be seen by considering the
definition of Steiner trees in \Cref{sec:steiner-tree}. This corresponds to the
proof of the fourth property, but here $N_1 = N$ and $N_2 = N_3 = 0$, meaning
that the number of Steiner points will be exactly $N-2$.

It can furthermore be shown that any Steiner tree is a union of edge-disjoint
\glspl{fst}, meaning that any edge of a \gls{smt} joining to regular points is also
an edge of \gls{mst} of the regular points. This is relatively easily seen, by
realizing that every three points connected to a Steiner point is a \gls{fst} for
those three points. These are then either connected to the rest of the tree with
a Steiner point, in which case they are part of a bigger \gls{fst}, or they are
connected to a regular point, in which case we can we can remove that edge to
have one \gls{fst} and the rest of the tree.

The topology of a \gls{fst} is called a full Steiner topology, also abbreviated
\gls{fst}. Here we have the fixed coordinates of the regular points, but not the
coordinates of the Steiner points, and as such we only think about the
adjacencies of the points. Whether we are talking about the topology or tree
will be clear from the context.

\subsection{Steiner minimal tree}
\label{sec:steiner-minimal-tree}

A minimal tree on $N$ points $\vec{x}_{1},\vec{x}_{2},\ldots,\vec{x}_{n}$ is the
tree having these points as its vertices and having the smallest possible sum of
the length of all its edges. When we are allowed to insert any number of extra
points into the tree and connect the edges using these to further shorten the
tree this is known as a \gls{smt}~\cite{Gilbert1968}.

\NOTE[inline]{This could probably be fleshed out a bit more}

\section{Euclidean Steiner tree problem}
\label{sec:eucl-stein-tree}

The \gls{estp} is the problem of finding the \gls{smt} for the set of points $N$
in Euclidean $d$-space. I.e\ each point $x_{i}, 1 \le i \le n$ is a $d$-vector,
and the metric used to calculate the length of the edges connecting the points
is the $L^2$-norm, the Euclidean norm.

The work of this thesis is only concerned with the Euclidean version of the
Steiner tree problem in $d$-space.
